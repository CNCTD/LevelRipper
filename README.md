# LevelRipper

Ever wanted to get all of your old levels back from huge save files that crashed the game, well now you can, sort of. 
Assuming this cheaply written hacky program actually works.

First, drag and drop the save file to the same directory as the script and default.gmd.
Next, open cmd, cd to the directory and run python main.py -i.
After that, first type 1, which will convert the save file to an xml.
Then type 2, which will give you a list of all the levels in the save to levels.txt.
Once this is done scroll through levels.txt and find anything you want.
Once you have the level name type 4, you will be prompted for the name, enter it.
Assuming all goes to plan you will be left with a gmd file.
